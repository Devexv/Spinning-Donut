# Spinning-Donut

This is a compact and obfuscated C program that generates a graphical representation of a 3D landscape using ASCII characters.

## Description

The program utilizes trigonometric functions and clever manipulation of characters to create the illusion of a 3D landscape or pattern within the console window. It iterates over a range of angles to calculate the positions of characters in a 2D array, which are then printed to the console.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. You will see the ASCII landscape evolving in the console window.

## Features

- Compact and obfuscated code for brevity and cleverness.
- Utilizes ANSI escape codes to clear the console and position the cursor.
- Generates a dynamic landscape that evolves over time based on trigonometric calculations.
